## IxC: The Broader Context to Trust & Safety

**Defining the Field**: 
At its core, Interaction Cartography maps and understands the intricate web of exchanges, dynamics, and touchpoints that constitute our interactions, whether in digital spaces, urban environments, or interpersonal relationships. By doing so, it brings to light the underlying patterns, biases, and systems that influence these interactions.

**Beyond Digital Platforms**: 
While Trust & Safety teams primarily focus on the safety of online communities, Interaction Cartography extends its scope to analyze and address challenges across various industries and sectors. This includes urban planning, service design, public policy, and more.

**Interdisciplinary Approach**: 
Interaction Cartography is not restricted to technologists or policy makers alone. It invites anthropologists, sociologists, urban planners, designers, psychologists, and other experts to contribute their insights, ensuring a holistic understanding of interactions and their implications.

**Ethical Considerations**: 
Much like Trust & Safety's commitment to remove harmful content, Interaction Cartography emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in all interactions. This involves recognizing and addressing dark patterns, hostile designs, and unintended consequences in various interaction scenarios.

**Proactive vs. Reactive**: 
While Trust & Safety teams often react to harmful content, Interaction Cartography aims to be proactive. By mapping out potential touchpoints of friction or harm, it seeks to design systems and interactions that prevent harm from occurring in the first place.

**Training and Development**: 
Just as the Trust & Safety team invests in AI and machine-based moderation, Interaction Cartography champions the development and use of tools, methodologies, and technologies that can better map, understand, and optimize interactions across various domains.
