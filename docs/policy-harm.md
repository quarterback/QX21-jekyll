# Policy Harm

Much of the my personal frustration with the current state of web ideas are the lack of awareness around policy harms. The companion to policy harm is administrative burden. I've written a lot about friction and it's part of these ideas, too. Namely, if you can frustrate someone enough, it's easy to get them to do what you want them to do.

In the case of public policy wants, burdening people or forcing them to have "skin in the game," gives a bureaucract the feeling they're weeding out grifters. It's the freeloader problem applied to public policy. In the context of non-public policy related issues, policy harm is still present and neglected, especially in the era of "move fast and break things."
