# What is Consequence Design?

Consequence Design is a practice and framework I’ve developed over the past several years to critically examine how interfaces, systems, and technological implementation shape daily life. It’s a way of asking: did it have to be this way? Who benefits? Who is burdened? And what are the consequences of seemingly minor design choices at scale?

Born out of my work across service design, digital transformation, and public sector delivery, Consequence Design emerged not from a theoretical impulse, but from the lived realities of bad services—especially for the most structurally disadvantaged. This isn’t just about digital services or dark patterns. It’s about how systems encode indifference, how they obscure harm, and how our assumptions around “good intentions” often shield real institutional failures from critique.

The framing began as a response to the utopianism of service design. It evolved into a diagnostic lens—one I’ve used to examine platform logic, AI implementation, administrative burdens, and interface governance. It’s also the backbone of my evolving academic work exploring consequence, spectacle, obfuscation, and institutional resilience.

If you’re looking for a framework to interrogate why systems feel cruel, why platforms are so good at avoiding responsibility, or why “helpful” technologies so often make life harder for real people—Consequence Design might help you see the terrain more clearly.

<em>Feel free to reach out via email if you want to talk more about the ideas here or how they connect to your own work. I’m especially interested in collaborations that test, challenge, or evolve this framing—and help us better understand what systems owe to the people they shape.</em>
