# What is Consequence Design?

Consequence design, as I've come to see it, is akin to the doormat in front of a house. At first glance, it's just a welcoming gesture. But when lifted, hidden complexities and previously invisible entities scuttle away from the light.

For years, this concept lingered on the edges of design discussions, unnamed and unformulated. The world buzzed about service design, which inherently aims to streamline and enhance service delivery. But too often, these discussions operated under a utopian assumption of universal good intentions.

Venturing across the United States reveals glaring disparities in service design. From the pitfalls of Greyhound buses and low-cost airlines to the inconveniences in transit stations, it's evident that certain demographics are consistently subjected to inferior services. This isn't confined to public services. Business decisions, driven by economic motives, have given rise to phenomena like 'food deserts'. These aren't mere business decisions; they're service design flaws.

Yet, in the mainstream, service design discussions are dominated by Post-It notes, jargon, and technocrats. These actors, however well-meaning, cannot navigate the intricacies of systems entrenched in socio-economic barriers. The realization? Service design isn't a panacea. It doesn't magically resolve systems designed to perpetuate inequalities.

It's time to delve deeper. Beyond the UX dark patterns and beyond mere digital annoyances, there's a pressing need to critically assess and rethink our systems. A tweet of mine from years back encapsulates a sentiment many share: when confronted with automated voice systems, just press '0' or demand an 'operator'. We crave genuine, human interaction.

### Exhibits & Projects

- [**Consequence Design AI**](https://ronbronson.notion.site/012a37b4db0a412dbcfde85c769a23f7?v=569092e883644f76af15b75b24da439c&pvs=74): This 2023 project uses generative AI tools to imagine scenarios around privacy, trust, harm & consequence. 
  
- [**A Parliament of Neighbors**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwemDtD4mTk): What does it mean to be a neighbor? I conducted an in-person and virtual exhibit at a vibrant kunsthalle at a dead mall in Portland in May 2023
  
- [**The Designer's Share of the Problem**](https://vimeo.com/651801535): In 2021, I spoke at IxDA Oslo more about the *Designer's Share of the Problem* which builds atop the consequence design framework to ask what we're complicit for, what our responsibility is and what's next?
  
- [**Defense Against Dark Patterns**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nLretWklAo): In 2020, I gave my first public talk about Consequence Design (after writing all this stuff years earlier) at donutjs in Portland.
  
- [**Consequence Design interview**](https://www.editorx.com/shaping-design/article/ron-bronson-interview-consequence-design): A longform interview I did for EditorX with Oliver Lindberg on Consequence Design back in the early days of these ideas.
